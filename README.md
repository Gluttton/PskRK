==========================================================
PslRK - set of references and programs related with Peak Sidelobe Level of binary sequences:
- [Related with topic references](References) - set of links and documents which contain
    proofs, results of research, confirmations of approaches and other related information;
- [Low PSL code detectors](Solutions) - set of solutions of the problem of finding binary
    sequences with low PSL level;
