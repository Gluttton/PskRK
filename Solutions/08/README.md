Low PSL code detector
=====================
Detector of codes with low peak sidelobe (PSL) level.
The detector is written on C++ and its main features are:
 - using `std::bitset` as storage of binary sequence;
 - using randomly generated sequences instead of sequentially generated.



System requirements
===================
Solution is cross-platfrom.
To build program C++ compiler is required.



Usage
